Quilt mod that makes your cauldrons _based_.

### What? How?

It uses things from Fabric Transfer API to restructure how cauldrons work.
In vanilla, cauldrons literally just use block state to indicate the fluid they store, which is just so dumb.
This mod changes this by making cauldrons instead have a separate block entity that stores fluid data.
All things are done with the standard of Fabric Transfer API, so it should be theoretically compatible with any fluids added by other mods.

Several new features are planned, like Beta 1.9 Pre-release 2 alike brewing system ~~and dyeing functionality~~ (Implemented).

But still, compatibility with other mods that also modify cauldrons is **not guaranteed**.

### It doesn't run with Fabric :sob:

Go make a quilt with your fabric :rage:
